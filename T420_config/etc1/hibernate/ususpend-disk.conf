# the kernel. You will require the s2disk binary to be installed - this can be
# downloaded from http://suspend.sourceforge.net/ . On Debian systems, just
# install the uswsusp package.
# Add any configuration options specific to ususpend to this file. Ordering is
# not crucial, and options are not case-sensitive.
