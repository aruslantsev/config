Cruft detection tool for Gentoo


This is my branch with additional false positives coming from 3 real gentoo systems (64bit) and 1 virtual gentoo system (32bit). Original hollow branch produced >50kb of cruft for each system in my environment so I added several additional package files containing addtional false positives.
