# /usr/man and /usr/doc symlinks pointing to the appropriate
# subdirs of /usr/share (some ebuilds use the wrong ones):
echo /usr/man /usr/share/man
echo /usr/doc /usr/share/doc

# /usr/lib/terminfo points to /usr/share/terminfo, but
# x11-terms/xterm installs into the former
echo /usr/lib/terminfo /usr/share/terminfo
